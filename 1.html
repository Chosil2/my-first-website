<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-html52-20171214/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.

By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".  The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way.</p>
